# Mandelbrot Set Visualization in Processing

Welcome to the `mandlebrotSet` repository, where you can find a Processing sketch designed to generate visualizations of the Mandelbrot set, one of the most famous examples of a fractal in mathematics. The Mandelbrot set is named after the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot and is known for its intricate and infinitely complex boundary.

## Prerequisites

- [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/) or newer.

## Setup and Running

1. Install Processing: Download and install Processing from the official [Processing website](https://processing.org/download/).

2. Clone the Repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Marqui-13/mandlebrotSet.git

3. Open the Sketch: Open Processing, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo, and open `mandlebrotSet.pde`.

4. Run the Sketch: Click the "Play" button or press `Ctrl + R` to start the sketch. The visualization of the Mandelbrot set will automatically begin, displaying the fractal pattern.

## Exploring the Mandelbrot Set

The sketch is configured to visualize the Mandelbrot set across a specified range and resolution. You can explore different parts of the set by adjusting the `xMin`, `yMin`, `w` (width), and `h` (height) variables. The `maxIterations` variable determines the depth of the calculation and, consequently, the detail and color variation of the visualization.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the visualization, optimize the code, or enhance documentation are welcome. Please fork the repository, implement your changes, and submit a pull request.
